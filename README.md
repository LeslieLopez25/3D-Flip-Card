<h1>3D Flip Card :flower_playing_cards:</h1>

<h2>A 3d flip card created using only HTML and CSS.</h2>

<p>This website is created using flexbox, grid, and CSS custom properties. I created this following the tutorial of CodingLab. I've changed the color scheme, image, and updated the values of measures from px to rem. I enjoyed building this little project. It uses properties that I've never used before and it's beginner friendly too.</p>
